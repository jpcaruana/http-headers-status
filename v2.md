# Changes in Version 2 #

## Document Format ##

Historically, I have used the standard .vsd format for editing the diagram, but I have had a request to use the XML variant instead and I am happy to oblige. So now the diagram will be in .vdx format.

## Coordinate Matrix ##

I have put in a coordinate matrix to make finding a particular diagram item easier.

  * To reference a decision icon, use the form _{version}:{column}{row}_ for example **v2:B1**

  * To reference a decision arrow, use the form _{version}:{column}{row},{true|false}_ for example **v2:B1,false**

  * To reference a decision endpoint, use the form _{version}:{column}{row},{true|false}=_ for example **v2:B1,false=** with an optional text label for readability, e.g. **v2:B1,false="503 Service Unavailable"**

## 414 Request URI Too Long ##

Moved **v1:B3** to **v2:B2** as it makes sense to validate the HTTP Request-Line first, and then assess if the request as a whole is malformed.

## Last-Modified > If-Modified-Since? ##

Resolved logic error. Swapped true / false arrows exiting v2:G13 (if the resource has a last modification date before or equal to the If-Modified-Since value, then 304 Unmodified should be returned).

## Extended DELETE response decisions ##

I have extended the decision tree following DELETE **{todo:location}** to cater for the 202 Accepted (but not yet enacted) response and if the response contains an entity.

## Superfluous HTTP-Method check ##

Removed superfluous decision icon at **v1:E3** (already checked by **v2:B7**)

## Extended POST decisions ##

Due to feedback, I have shown the decision tree that if a POST creates a resource with no URI then 200 or 204 are returned (this has caused a fairly significant change in the layout of the diagram).
